## MxNet:
The subject of face recognition has made substantial use of the potent deep learning framework MXNet. MXNet's versatility and scalability, which enable it to easily handle big datasets and complex models, are among its key features. Moreover, MXNet offers a broad selection of pre-trained models and tools for face recognition jobs, which can considerably cut down on the time and effort needed to develop a unique solution. MXNet is a great option for real-time face recognition applications due to its excellent performance and effective memory utilisation. MXNet is a useful resource for anyone looking to create sophisticated face recognition systems overall.

## MTCNN

The Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCCNN) has a number of advantages over conventional face identification methods, including:



1. High accuracy: It has been demonstrated that MTCNN can detect faces with high accuracy rates, even in difficult situations like dim lighting, occlusion, or different orientations.


2. Versatility: MTCNN is more versatile than other models since it can detect faces at various scales and orientations.


3. Speed: MTCNN is quick and effective, making it appropriate for real-time applications like live streaming or video surveillance.


4. MTCNN is capable of carrying out numerous tasks at once, including face alignment, facial landmark detection, and face detection.


5. Low false positive rate: Because of MTCNN's low false positive rate, it is less likely to mistakenly identify non-faces as faces.

## ArcFace

- ArcFace is a face recognition method that has good accuracy while handling large-scale face recognition datasets.

- ArcFace performs at the cutting edge on benchmark datasets including LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C.


- Since ArcFace can handle facial recognition tasks in real-time, it is appropriate for applications like access control and video surveillance.

- The resilient algorithm can adapt to changes in illumination, position, and expression.

- ArcFace is more resilient than other algorithms since it can extract distinguishing information from faces even under difficult situations.

- ArcFace is simple to use and can be improved with more information.

- Its open-source implementation is frequently used in facial recognition systems and is accessible.
